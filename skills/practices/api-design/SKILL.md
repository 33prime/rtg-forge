# API Design

> This skill is under development.

Cross-cutting patterns for designing clean, consistent REST APIs.

## Topics to Cover

- REST resource naming conventions (plural nouns, no verbs)
- HTTP method semantics (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Status code usage guide
- Consistent error response shape (`{ error, message, details }`)
- Pagination patterns (offset, cursor, keyset)
- Filtering and sorting conventions
- API versioning strategies (URL path, header)
- Rate limiting headers
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- HATEOAS links (when appropriate)
