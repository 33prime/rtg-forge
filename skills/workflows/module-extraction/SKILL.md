# Module Extraction

> This skill is under development.

Workflow for identifying and extracting reusable modules from existing codebases. Extract when a pattern is used in 3+ places and has stabilized.

## Topics to Cover

- Identifying extraction candidates (rule of three)
- Defining module boundaries and public interface
- Dependency analysis: what does the module need?
- Interface design: protocols, abstract base classes
- Step-by-step extraction process
- Testing strategy: tests before, during, and after extraction
- Avoiding circular dependencies
- Versioning extracted modules
- Documentation requirements for extracted modules
