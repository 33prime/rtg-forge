# BAD Code Review Approach

## Anti-Patterns

- "LGTM" without reading the code
- Only checking if the code compiles/builds
- Focusing on naming/formatting that a linter should catch
- Reviewing a 2000-line PR in one sitting
- Not checking for missing tests
- Approving because the author is senior
- Bikeshedding on minor style preferences
- Not running the code locally
- Ignoring migration files ("they're auto-generated")
- Reviewing only the diff, not understanding the context
